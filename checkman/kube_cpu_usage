description:
 This check shows the CPU usage of a Kubernetes object, its request utilization and its limit
 utilization.

 Request utilization is the CPU usage divided by the sum of all configured container CPU
 requests. Limit utilization is computed in the same manner. The utilization percentage values are
 omitted if any of the associated request/limit value are not configured. Moreover, limit
 utilization is omitted if any container has a limit of zero. The reason for omission is displayed
 in the check's details.

 The service includes metrics for the CPU usage, the request utilization, the limit utilization,
 the CPU request and CPU limit of the Kubernetes object.

 By default, the service goes to {WARN} or {CRIT}, if the limit utilization passes 80.0% or 90.0%,
 respectively. There are no default levels regarding the request utilization, i.e. the service is
 {OK} irrespective of request utilization. This behaviour can be changed via the rule Kubernetes
 CPU resource utilization.

 The check requires that the special agent kube is configured.

discovery:
 One service is created per Kubernetes object.
