Title: LDAP: Fix handling of groups containing "#" in Active Directory

Class: fix

The Active Directory allows users to use "#" characters in group names
and distinguished names (DNs). Previous version of Checkmk were not able to
use these groups for the roles attribute synchronization.

With this change it is now possible to use group DNs like this:
"CN=#abc,OU=xyz,DC=corp,DC=com".
