When fetching the data from a Checkmk agent (unix/windows),
the fetcher would establish a connection before checking
the cache file. If the cached data was still valid the
connections has been closed.

These "unused" connections could lead to unwanted agent
executions or, in Checkmk 2.1, to irritating errors
in the log of <tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt> on the monitored host,
such as <i>"Request failed: tls handshake eof"</i> or
<i>"Request failed: Connection reset by peer (os error 104)"</i>.
