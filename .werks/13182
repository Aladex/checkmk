The output of hosts running VMware version >= 7 contains a different data
format than expected in earlier versions. This leads to services being
generated based on the HBA paths, and not multipaths. This has been fixed.
Note that due to this fix, some paths that do not belong to multipath (i.e.
paths that are not derived from vSAN) are no longer discovered.
