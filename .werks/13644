Title: Deprecating NSCA as part of Checkmk

With Checkmk 2.1 we officially deprecate the component NSCA which has
traditionally been a part of Checkmk but was rarely used. In 2.1 it will work
as before and be removed with Checkmk 2.2.

If you are a user of NSCA with Checkmk an alternative solution depends on your
specific use case. You could try to use local plugins with the Checkmk agent
(https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/agent_linux.html#mrpe) or utilize the spool
directory mechanism of the agent #16 (https://checkmk.com/werk/16).

If you can't find a good replacement for your use case, please contact us via
your support contact.
