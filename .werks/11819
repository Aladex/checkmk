From ntopng verion 5, a new REST API version (v2) is used. This exposes different endpoints for querying alert information.
With this werk, the new REST API version is supported.

<b>Note:</b> Due to a change in ntopng REST APIv2, the hour selection in the alert crossfilter is currently not working.
