This werk reorganizes the way information about the agent deployment is presented.

It is only incompatible for users that configured rules using the rule
"<i>Checkmk agent plugins</i>", which was only present in Checkmk version 2.1.0b1.
That rule is deprecated and must be reconfigured accordingly.
No further action must be taken.

The service "Check_MK Agent" now includes the monitoring of deployed agent plugins
and local checks. You can configure expected versions using the ruleset "<i>Checkmk Agent</i>".

Since the service no longer exclusively deals with information regarding the agent
update, the service check command is changed from <tt>check_mk-check_mk_agent_update</tt>
to <tt>check_mk-checkmk_agent</tt>.
