On ruleset pages users may add a rule by clicking buttons of different context information. These
buttons are now sorted with respect to their relevance for users. The new order is
<ul><li>Add rule</li>
<li>Add rule for current host (and service/device, if available)</li>
<li>Add rule in folder <folder_name></li></ul>
