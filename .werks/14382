Prior to this Werk, trying to authenticate to an LDAP server that is unavailable would result in an error saying that the server could be contacted.
This leaks the address of the LDAP server.
In addition, it was possible to check if a user is a htpasswd user, since the LDAP connection is not attempted for these users and LDAP error is not shown.

Now a generic "invalid login" message is shown to avoid this information disclosure.
