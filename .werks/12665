Checkmk servers which not only use the local system user and group database (/etc/passwd and /etc/group), but also use an integration with a 3rd party system could run into performance issues. A common example for such a setup is an LDAP integration.
This happened, for example, with <tt>omd su sitename</tt> or with any check_mk_agent (calls <tt>omd status --bare</tt>)
